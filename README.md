=========

Yet another arduino-like board, with the benefits of having a sane 2.54mm pin spacing. Also have the advantage of being a through-hole design, making it perfect for a beginner soldering project.

It is also cheap to build, as the board is less than the 5x5cm size required for the lowest price tier at several chinese prototyping serivces (IteadStudio, SeeedStudio, Elecrow).

The distance between the two rows of headers (17 mil) makes it suited for 5cm wide protoboards (which come very cheaply, as opposed to 'real' arduino proto-shields).

The project sprang out of a wish to improve my very first project, the [Cheapuino]
